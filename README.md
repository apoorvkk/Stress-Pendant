# Summary
This was the frontend and final implementation of the Stress Pendant project. The Stress Pendant project aimed to collect stress
data about the general public. A small squeezable pendant was created by the Sensilab and was distributed to thousands of 
individuals across Melbourne. Whenever an individual felt stressed, they would squeeze the pendant. The pendant would transmit
the stress signal to a bluetooth connected mobile device which should have the Stress Pendant app. The Stress Pendant app
shows a personalized dashaboard of a given individual's stress data and transmits this data to a centralized server (Firebase).
Finally, there a website pulls this data and produces data visualizations of the stress data in a compact dashboard for researchers.
This repository maintains the website.
